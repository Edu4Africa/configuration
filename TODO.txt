* fix auto-registration of new oauth2 client in LMS (insights role)
    * the new version of edx-oauth2-provider is not being installed for some reason?
* manual addition of "DEBUG: true" to /edx/etc/insights.yml in order to get django to serve static assets from "runserver"
* had to manually run "python manage.py migrate" on the insights app
* EXTRA_SCOPES = ['permissions'] in insights base.py settings
    * LMS master rejects this scope?


* document instructions
    * vagrant up
    * as vagrant user run "cd /edx/app/edx_ansible/edx_ansible/playbooks/edx-east && /edx/app/edx_ansible/venvs/edx_ansible/bin/ansible-playbook -i localhost, -c local analytics_single.yml"
